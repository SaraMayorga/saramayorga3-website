        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Linguistics ðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">I worked very diligently as a Cashier, self-checkout host, customer service desk associate, and front-end freight worker, making sure that every customer I came across in my daily duties is satisfied with their service and can go home feeling satisfied with their visit. Iâ€™ve handled accurate cash operations and transactions, answered questions for any customers, and help resolve any issues or burning questions they have. I also always made sure to have a smile on my face anytime I was approached by anyone, even now that masks are required to be worn, it still wonâ€™t keep me from showing them my friendliness. <br><br>

        I make sure to always greet my assigned students with a smile and ask how they are feeling before getting started with any work. I ensure that our class time is not always strictly work but is also a safe space to have fun and speak about their mental health. Either way, I make sure to stick to the agenda and steer us back to the point if we ever stray away from it as a group.<br><br>

        I am known by many as a strong student with lots of motivation and good habits which help me reach my goals. I am also very stubborn when it comes to fixing a problem or getting a task done. I wonâ€™t take defeat for an answer. I enjoy working in groups and even individually if it is required. I remember being faced with a hard customer service experience while my time at Walmart, but I was able to fix it by staying calm and allowing the customer to explain their frustrations and what made them mad, but after they did that, I was able to successfully help them and let them go home happy. The importance of listening in a setting where you are taking care of lots of customers and having to help them is honestly where you will get plenty of compliments and awards for being such a polite, understanding, and helpful person. Ever since I was a small child, I always loved to help and make sure I was able to assist those who were less fortunate or who could not get the help others could get. I never liked to see anyone confused or stressed out because they didnâ€™t understand instructions or didnâ€™t understand an assignment completely. Despite stressing and struggling myself, I make sure that others donâ€™t feel how I do because it most definitely does not feel good. Sometimes I can be too involved in a task someone is doing, but I just consider myself to be caring. Thatâ€™s why I would choose to become a speech pathologist. It seems like an interesting job and helps younger kids and even teens who arenâ€™t able to speak for themselves or have a hard time pronouncing words. I have always wanted to work with children or adults in the medical field and be able to give them a second chance. Careers in surgery are very expensive, which is why I went with something smaller, like speech pathology.
